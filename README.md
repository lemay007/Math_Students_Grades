# Math_Students_Grades

Dataset collected from UCI Data Set: https://techwithtim.net/tutorials/machine-learning-python/linear-regression/

Within the Jupyter Notebook you will see my linear regression model. I imported the data into a Pandas Dataframe and used the sklearn package in order to develop a Machine Learning algorithim to predict a student's final grade based on 9 independent factors.
